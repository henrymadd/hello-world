# hello-world
First practice repository
My name is Henry.
I am 30 years old.
I want to change careers. I have a degree in psychology, yet I've always have had an interest in computers.
I would like to switch over to web development, so I'm trying my hand at it through theodinproject.com
I'm going to keep at it, go all the way through the course and see where it takes me.
